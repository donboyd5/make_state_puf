# Project Statement of Work
See [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K-3V3Acfeoyc5VvcPNnfsFkUq37fgMQEOSmR3_yGENA/edit?usp=sharing). Also see the separate rmd and md file on the OSPC agreement.

The primary goals of this project are to (1) adapt and extend methods and tools developed in previous incubator projects, allowing us to develop state-specific income tax microdata files from the existing IRS SOI national Public Use File (PUF), and (2) develop at least one preliminary file for one state.


# Yimeng's Project Statement of Work
> Augment Boydâ€™s current project in which he is developing methods for creating a single state microdata tax file, in two ways: (a) rigorously compare file quality under several different approaches under investigation, and (b) port the approach that produces the best results from R to Python so that it can readily be integrated with TaxData.


<!-- First set things up, then run things -->


# Set things up

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
```


```{r system_specific_info, include=FALSE}
# change these as needed
# pufdir <- "C:/Users/donbo/Dropbox/OSPC - Shared/IRS_pubuse_2011/"

```


```{r loads}
source(here::here("r/includes", "libraries.r"))
source(here::here("r/includes", "globals.r"))
globals
source(here::here("r/includes", "functions_state_puf.r"))

```



# Outline of work
[TO COME]


# Steps

## Get names of essential PUF variables, based on synthetic files and what we learned after
```{r ONETIME_vnames, eval=FALSE}
globals
df <- read_csv("C:/Users/donbo/Google Drive/synpuf/syntheses/synpuf20_no_disclosures.csv", n_max=0)
ns(df)
# variables needed to run the file through tax calculator -- see note below
# E03260  Deduction for self-employment tax
# XOCAH   Exemptions for Children Living at Home
# XOCAWH  Exemptions for Children Living Away from Home
# XOODEP  Exemptions for Other Dependents 
# XOPAR   Exemptions for Parents Living at Home or Away from Home

# we will get other variables after we run the "grown" file through Tax-Calculator
#   c00100 --> E00100  AGI
#   c02500 --> E02500  Social Security benefits in AGI
#   c04800 --> E04800  Regular taxable income
needed_puf_vars <- c(names(df), "E03260", "XOCAH", "XOCAWH", "XOODEP", "XOPAR")
saveRDS(needed_puf_vars, here::here("data", "needed_puf_vars.csv"))
# readRDS(here::here("data", "needed_puf_vars.csv"))

# prepare state targets for 2011 and 2017
```{r ONETIME_targets, eval=FALSE}

# two steps:
#   1) run file through tax-calculator to add agi2017 and certain other calculated variables

# readRDS(paste0(globals$statedir, "puf2017_weighted.rds")) # this is the national file for 2017

# construct ratio-adjusted weights for all states, and save them -- a starting point for optimization
```{r ONETIME_state_ratio_adjusted_weights}

```{r optimize_single_state}
# reweight the file by 2017 AGI bins to hit or come close to state targets (Ipopt, python can be CVXOPT)
